# Digital_Twin_Modelling
## Problem Statement
The field of industrial automation often requires the execution of repetitive tasks such as pick and place operations. However, accessing and operating the physical hardware of industrial cobots like the Doosan M1013 can be cumbersome and time-consuming. Additionally, hardware limitations, maintenance issues, and potential errors can hinder the efficiency and effectiveness of the operations.

The aim of this project is to address these challenges by creating a digital twin of the Doosan M1013 cobot using Visual Components and DART Studio. The digital twin will serve as a virtual replica of the physical robot, allowing users to perform pick and place operations without the need for direct access to the hardware. By developing a comprehensive virtual environment and accurately modeling the cobot's behavior, we aim to provide a reliable and efficient solution for simulating and executing operations in an accessible manner.
